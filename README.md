# AutoMate-NYC

Visit our app [here](http://137.43.49.42/). Watch the promotional video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e8C7oQAm1JQI5eAlvDbQjMF5HIkOICs8/view?usp=sharing)

This is a group project by six Master's students. We incorporated historical data to train the busyness level in Manhattan. 
The app is tailored towards car users who live in Manhattan. There are 600+ car parks to choose from! Additionally, there are 
other amenities, such as fuel and petrol stations. Below is the list of some of the features:
  -  Route from A to B
  -  Reroute through a fuel/charging station
  -  Checking the level of busyness at a later date
  -  Live news alert
  -  Set a radius around the destination to filter car parks
  -  Nearest car park recommendation
  -  Save favourite car parks
  -  Weather and 5-day forecast
  -  Rating feature
  -  Feedback feature

# Personal Contributions:
My role in this project was front-end lead. I worked mostly with React. I also worked with Figma initially during the design phase of the project.
I also made the promotional video in Hitfilm Express. Voice-over was done through ElevenLabs text-to-speech AI tool.
